## Users

A `User` represents a person who has been authenticated with the Velt SDK. 

Once a `User` has been authenticated, their profile can be seen within Velt's collaboration features.

For example in the `Comments` feature, the `User's` name is shown by their comment and in `@mentions`.

Additionally in the `Presence` and in `Cursors` features, the `User's` name is shown by their avatar bubble and mouse cursors.

## User schema

A `User` has the following schema:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `userId` | `string` | The user's unique identifier. |
| `name` | `string` | The user's display name. |
| `email` | `string` | The user's email address. |
| `photoUrl` | `string` | The URL of the user's profile photo. |
| `groupId`  | `string `| Your user's group ID |                                   
| `contacts` | `UserContact[]` | An array of User Contact objects |
| `plan`     | `string` | Your user's plan |


## User groups

`Users` in the same group get added to each other's contact list.

Over time, as `Users` from the same `groupId` sign in, they will be automatically added to each other's contact list.

They can then `@mention` or assign each other when they make comments.


## User contacts list

`UserContacts` are used to load the list of people that a user can `@mention` or assign when they make a comment. As we mentioned before, `Users` in the same `groupId` will get added to each other's contact lists.

A User has a `contacts` attribute that has an array of `UserContact` objects. A `UserContact` has the following schema:


| Field     | Type                | Description                                               |
| --------  | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userId`    | `string`              | Unique user identifier that you use to identify your user |
| `name`      | `string` | Your user's full name                                     |
| `photoUrl`  | `string` | Your user's avatar URL                                    |
| `email`     | `string` | Your user's email                                         |
| `groupId`   | `string` | Your user's group ID (only used for reference) |
| `visibility`| `string` | Either 'private' or 'group'|

You can set the `UserContacts` list to be empty initially or you can preload it with a list of contacts upon user authentication. If you preload the contact list, other members of the authenticated `User's` `groupId` will also see the preloaded contacts unless the `UserContact` has `visibility` set to `private`.

### User contact visibility

The `visibility` attribute on a `UserContact` object is either set to `private` or `group`.

When it is set to `private`, they will only be added to the authenticated `User's` contact list and will not be added to any other `User's` contact list even if they have the same `groupId`.

When it is set to `group`, they will be added to the contact lists of all `User's` with the same `groupId` as the authenticated `User`.
