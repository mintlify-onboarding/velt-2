<Steps titleSize="h2">

<Step title="Create a User object">

Create a `User` object with the following initial fields.

```jsx
let user = {
  userId:"123",
  name:"Bob",
  email:"bob@gmail.com",
  photoURL:'https://i.pravatar.cc/300'
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set a groupId">

Set the `groupId` on the `User` object you just created.

Over time, as users from the same `groupId` sign in, they will be automatically added to each other's contact list.

```js
  user.groupId = 'somegroupid';
```

<Warning>
No special characters such as dashes are allowed in `groupId`
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Manually preload the user contact list"> 

Provide the `contacts` field on your `User` object with an array of `UserContact` objects.

This will preload the `User` contact list with an initial list of contacts.

```js
 const contacts = [
        {
          userId: 'd5558f1f-bdea-4eb5-9fd5-ed657e460307',
          name: 'John Doe',
          photoUrl: 'https://i.pravatar.cc/300',
          email: 'john.doe@snippyly.com',
          groupId: 'somegroupid', //used only for reference
          visibility: 'group' //set visibility to `group` to add the contact to all members of the groupId
        },
        {
          userId: 'd5558f1f-bdea-4eb5-9fd5-ed657e460308',
          name: 'Mary Doe',
          photoUrl: 'https://i.pravatar.cc/300',
          email: 'mary.doe@snippyly.com',
          groupId: 'somegroupid', //used only for reference
          visibility: 'private' // set visibilty to `private` to only add the contact to the authenticated User 
        }
      ];
      user.contacts = contacts;
```

By default, all members of the same `groupId` as the authenticated `User` will also have this list of `UserContacts` added to their contacts list.

<Info>Setting visibility to `private` will only add the `UserContact` to the authenticated `User's` contact list instead of adding it to all `groupId` members.</Info>

<Note>Confused about the difference between `UserContact` and `User`? A `UserContact` is used solely to populate a contacts list and is not used to authenticate contacts in the list.</Note>
</Step>


<Step title="Authenticate your user">
Authenticate your `User` with the `identify()` method from the Velt client.

This will configure your `User` with the `groupId` and `contacts` list you set previously.

```jsx
client.identify(user)
```

</Step>

</Steps>

# Advanced Setup

## Replace Contact List

To replace a user's contact list, use the `client.identify()` method and pass in `{replaceContacts: true}` as the second parameter. This will completely replace the users contact list.

```jsx
client.identify(yourLoggedInUser, {
    replaceContacts: true
}).then((res) => {
  // User auth successful with Velt
}).catch((err) => {
  // Failed to authenticate user with Velt
});
```

## Private Contacts

To make a `UserContact` a private contact, meaning they will only be added to the authenticated `User's` contact list instead of to all group members' contact lists, set the `visibility` attribute to `private`.


```
{
  visibility: 'private'
}
```
