<Steps>
<Step title="Recorder Panel Id">

Sets the `recorderId` to determine which `VeltRecorderTool` the video comes from.

You must also set the `VeltRecorderTool` `panelId` to the same value as `recorderId` for the recording to show up on the `VeltRecorderPlayer`.

```js
<VeltRecorderTool panelId="YOUR_PANEL_ID" />
<VeltRecorderPlayer recorderId="YOUR_PANEL_ID"/>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Show Transcript">
Whether a transcript of a recording gets shown or not.

`Default: true`

The `VeltRecorderPlayer` will show a transcript of an audio, video or screen recording.

To enable or disable the transcript, set the `show` attribute:

```jsx
<VeltRecorderPlayer show={true}/>
```


</Step>


<Step title="onDelete callback">
The creator of the recordings will see an option to delete the recording after it has been recorded. Once the user deletes the recording, the `VeltRecorderPlayer` component will emit an event called `onDelete` with the recorder ID. You can listen to the callback and use the response object to perform any clean up on your end. 

This is the response object that you get back:

| Field    | Type                          | Example       |
| -------- | ------------------------------| --------------|
| id       | string                        | "recorder_id" |

```js
<VeltRecorderPlayer recorderId={RECORDER_ID} onDelete={(data) => yourDeleteMethod(data)} />
```
