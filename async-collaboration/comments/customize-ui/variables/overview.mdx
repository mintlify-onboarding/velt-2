To update CSS variables for the `Comment Tool`, please refer to [Global Styles](/global-styles/global-styles).

We recommend updating CSS globally instead of individually editting the CSS variables for each Velt component. 

However, if you want to edit the `Comment Tool` CSS variables individually, you can do so following the instructions in following pages.
