## Deleting Data by Location

You can delete all data at a specific `location` using an API call. Data refers to comments, recordings, or any other feature data relating to that `location`.


To dete all data by location via the API, send a POST request to `https://deletedatabylocation.api.velt.dev/` with the following body data.

Body:

```JSON
{
    "data": {
        "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "authToken": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
        "documentId": "YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID",
        "location": YOUR_LOCATION_OBJECT_HERE
    }
}
```

<Info>
Not sure where find your Auth Token? You can follow [these steps](/security/auth-tokens) to generate your Auth Token.

For example, if you want to delete all the data related to the `location` object with the id of "scene_1" shown below, then you will have to pass below data in body of the post method:

```jsx
{
    "data": {
        "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "authToken": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
        "documentId": "YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID",
        "location": {
            "id": "scene_1",
