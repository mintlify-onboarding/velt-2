## Overview

Velt uses the concept of `Documents` and `Locations` to organize collaborators into the same shared spaces and subspaces.

## Documents

Users set with the same `Document ID` can see each other's `Presence`, `Cursors`, `Comments` etc.


## Locations

If you want to add another layer of categorization to organize users together, you can use **Location**.

For an example, for a Collaborative Slide Presentation application, the **Document** would represent the entire slide presentation while the **Location** would represent an individual slide.

As another example, for a Collaborative Video Editor, the **Document** would represent the entire video player while the **Location** would represent the timestamps of each video frame.

<Tip> If a **Document** is like a house, a **Location** is like a room within the house. </Tip>

**Locations** are _completely optional_, you can opt to use them or not. If the complexity of your application does not require the use of **Locations**, you can use **Documents** by themselves to group your users together.

If you opt to use **Locations**, users in the same **Document** must also be in the same **Location** now to interact.
